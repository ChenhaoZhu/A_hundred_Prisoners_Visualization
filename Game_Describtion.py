# A_hundred_Prisoners_Visualization
  # This is a small project for creating a Graph for some stategy of an interesting Mathematical Question.
  # There are one hundred prisoners at the Jail
  # Now the Director wants to give these prisoners a chance to all be free, only if they win the game.
  # The rule is that :
  # 1. These 100 prisoners are numbered individually from 1 to 100.
  # 2. Director has 100 cards range from 1 to 100, no two cards have the same number.
  # 3. Director re-arranges the cards and put them on desk.
  # 4. Every individual prison have no more than 50 chances to pick the card to see whether he finds his corresponding number.
  # 5. If all 100 prisoners find their corresponding number, they are all free to go and win the game. Otherwise, they lose and will be dead in the future. :)
  # 6. Before the game, director give them enough time to figure out a strategy. But remember, previous people cannot give any clue or hint for the next one, they are all     independent trial.
