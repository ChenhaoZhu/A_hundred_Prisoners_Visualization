Here I just State Three Strategies I tested in my Code.

For the Random strategy, I just let everyone to pick randomly 50 cards.

For the split strategy, I let the odd-numbered people to pick the first 50 cards, and the even-numbered people to pick the last 50 cards.

For the jumping strategy, I let : {
            We assume people numbered A,
            Then he first goes to A th cards and open it. 
            if this is A, then we are done,
            if this is not A, but B ? Then he goes to B,
            
            This is a loop until we finally find A


                                  }
